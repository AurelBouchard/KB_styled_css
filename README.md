This CSS theme aims to imitate the look of the Logitech Craft keyboard.

This kb is really cool and after many month of use I think I will use it 'till death.

Whole keyboard

<a name="keys"></a>
## 3. Keys

Keys are really thin (non-mechanical) and the feeling can be compared to a laptop kb.

They have rounded corners and a central rounded depression except on function key tape and the lower tape (ctrl, alt, space ... ,ctrl)
